### Bosch Kaggle Competition Predicting Product Failure

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the failed products in a production line.The production line dataset is one of the largest public manufacturing datasets. Each observation represents a product, which moves through a production line. The features are anonymized. The naming of the feature follows the convention of “L#_S##_F####”, which representing the line, station, and feature number. The ground truth of whether a product is a failure is provided as a binary class, with 1 representing failure and 0 representing pass. The goal is to use the features to predict the failed product.
